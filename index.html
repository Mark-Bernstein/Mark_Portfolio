        <p>After attending Cal State University of San Marcos and receiving a
          Bachelor's Degree in Visual and Performing Arts, I decided to go back
          to school again and pursue something I felt to be much more challenging: programming.
          I then studyied computer science at San Diego Mesa College for 2 years with a 3.8GPA.
          My last major step was deciding to take my learning to the next level by joining the
          UCSD Coding Bootcamp.
        </p>

        <p>In my free time, I love to play guitar, make electronic music,
          go to the beach, and play volleyball, and of course spend time with friends and family.
        </p>

        <p>I am 28 years young and I was born in San Diego, California.
          Although that is where I still currently live (why would anyone want to stop living
          in San Diego!?), I do enjoy traveling to new destinations
          whenever given the chance.
